### Built with

- Basic CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework




### What I learned

This challenge realy helps me understand how things work , i used to learn a lot but cant build real stuff , nom im able ot at least 
i have the courage in any project , i understood a lot of stuff like : bootstrap , flexbox , css grid system , and many other details i cant 
list them all in this small desciption.





### Continued development

in this project , there was'nt any Js , or complicated stuff , it was a ready card in bootstrap all i did was some change
but if gets any complacted i would suffer , so i would rather working with more developed stuff like React , and thats what
i will focus on next months.
